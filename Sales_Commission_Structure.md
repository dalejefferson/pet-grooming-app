## Option A: Recurring Commission (6-Month Window)

**Structure:** 20% of MRR for the first 6 months per customer

| Sale Type | Commission | Total Earned Per Customer |
|---|---|---|
| Solo Monthly | $9/mo x 6 months | $54 |

| Sale Type | Commission |
|---|---|
| Solo Monthly | $45 per sale |
| Studio Monthly | $95 per sale |

**Pros:**
- Simplest to track and administer

## Recommended Starting Structure: Option B

Option B is recommended as the starting point because:

1. Simplest to track -- one sale = one payout, no recurring calculations
2. Lowest risk -- you pay once, then keep 100% of all recurring revenue
3. Motivating -- $45-$95 per sale is solid for outreach with warm leads
4. Upgradable -- easy to move to Option C later to reward high performance

## Income Projections for Salesperson

What the salesperson can expect to earn (Solo plan focus):

| Monthly Close Volume | Option A Earnings | Option B Earnings | Option C Earnings |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 sales/month | $90/mo (recurring 6mo) | $450 one-time | $202 + bonuses |
| 20 sales/month | $180/mo (recurring 6mo) | $900 one-time | $540 + $200 bonus |
| 30 sales/month | $270/mo (recurring 6mo) | $1,350 one-time | $1,013 + $200 bonus |
| 50 sales/month | $450/mo (recurring 6mo) | $2,250 one-time | $1,688 + $400 bonus |

*Option A earnings are monthly and accumulate as new customers are added. By month 3 with 20 closes/month, total monthly recurring commission would be ~$540/mo from all 60 active customers.*
